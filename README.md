# UL Library Website Redesign – Floor Plan Contribution

This repository contains **my contribution** to the UL Lafayette Dupré Library Website Redesign project.

### What I completed in this repository:
- Added an **interactive floor-plan page**
- Uploaded 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floor **map images**
- Implemented responsive page structure and image layout
- Prepared the HTML page to support future **clickable regions (image-map coordinates)**
