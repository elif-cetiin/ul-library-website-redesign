# UL Library Website Redesign – Floor Plan Contribution

This repository contains **my contribution** to the UL Lafayette Dupré Library Website Redesign project.

### What I completed in this repository:

- Added an interactive floor-plan page using HTML/CSS.
- Uploaded 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floor map images and optimized for responsive display.
- Created clickable regions (image-map coordinates) to allow users to navigate to related resources.
- Improved navigation clarity and user experience by enhancing accessibility and layout structure.
